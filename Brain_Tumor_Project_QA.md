# Brain Tumor MRI Classification – Interview Questions & Answers 
  
--- 

### 1) What is the goal of this project?  
**Answer:**  
The project builds an image-classification pipeline to distinguish brain MRI images into classes (`glioma`, `meningioma`, `no_tumor`, `pituitary`). It loads images, preprocesses them, trains CNNs (custom + pretrained), and evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

--- 

### 2) How is the dataset organized and why does that matter?
**Answer:**  
The dataset is organized into folders by split and class (e.g. `./data/train/glioma`). This allows automatic mapping of folder names to labels and reproducible splits. A consistent structure prevents mismatches and simplifies data loading.

---

### 3) What does the custom BrainTumorDataset class do?
**Answer:**  
It iterates over files, records image paths and labels, and applies transforms. On `__getitem__`, it loads the image, applies preprocessing, and returns `(image_tensor, label)`. Custom datasets give more control over labeling and preprocessing.

---

### 4) Why do we resize images to 224×224 in the transforms?
**Answer:**  
Pretrained models like ResNet expect 224×224 inputs. Resizing standardizes shape for batching and matches pretrained weight expectations. It reduces memory use but may lose detail if too much downsampling is applied.

---

### 5) Why use `transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485,0.456,0.406], std=[0.229,0.224,0.225])`?
**Answer:**  
These are ImageNet normalization values. They align MRI inputs with the pretrained model’s expected distribution, ensuring pretrained weights behave as intended.

---

### 6) What is DataLoader and why use `shuffle=True` for training?
**Answer:**  
DataLoader batches and loads data efficiently. `shuffle=True` ensures the model sees data in different orders each epoch, helping generalization and avoiding learning order-specific patterns.

---

### 7) Why check `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")`?
**Answer:**  
It detects GPU availability for faster training. Model and tensors must be moved to the same device for computations to work.

---

### 8) Explain the SimpleCNN model in plain language.
**Answer:**  
It stacks conv layers to learn patterns, uses ReLU for nonlinearity, pooling for downsampling, flattens features, and applies fully connected layers for classification.

---

### 9) What improvements does ImprovedCNN add over SimpleCNN?
**Answer:**  
It adds BatchNorm (stable training), more conv layers (richer features), and Dropout (reduces overfitting).

---

### 10) Why do we use `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` for this task?
**Answer:**  
It’s suitable for multi-class classification. It expects raw logits and labels, applies softmax internally, and measures prediction vs ground truth.

---

### 11) What does the training loop do (conceptually)?
**Answer:**  
For each batch: move data → zero gradients → forward pass → compute loss → backprop → optimizer step. Track loss/accuracy across epochs.
 
---

### 12) What is `model.train()` vs `model.eval()`?
**Answer:**  
- `train()`: enables dropout + batchnorm updates.  
- `eval()`: disables dropout, uses running stats → deterministic evaluation.

---

### 13) How are predictions converted to class labels?
**Answer:**  
Using `torch.max(outputs, 1)` which picks the index of the largest logit. This corresponds to the predicted class. 

---

### 14) How do you save and load a trained model?
**Answer:**  
- Save: `torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pt')`  
- Load: rebuild model → `model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pt'))` → move to device.

---

### 15) Why replace `model.fc` or `model.classifier[1]` in pretrained models?
**Answer:**  
ImageNet models predict 1000 classes. We replace the final layer with one matching our 4 classes while reusing earlier pretrained layers.

---

### 16) What is transfer learning and how is it applied here?
**Answer:**  
It reuses pretrained weights (from ImageNet). In this project, pretrained ResNet/MobileNet/EfficientNet models are fine-tuned after replacing the classifier.

---

### 17) Why freeze layers in transfer learning?
**Answer:**  
It keeps pretrained weights fixed, reduces compute, and avoids overfitting when data is small. Training focuses on the final classifier.

---

### 18) How is model performance evaluated?
**Answer:**  
Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

---

### 19) What is a confusion matrix and how do you read it?
**Answer:**  
Rows = true labels, columns = predicted. Diagonal = correct predictions. Off-diagonal = misclassifications.

---

### 20) Why is F1 score useful in medical classification?
**Answer:**  
It balances precision and recall. In medical tasks, both false negatives (missed disease) and false positives matter.

---

### 21) How do you handle class imbalance?
**Answer:**  
- Weighted loss  
- Oversampling minority classes  
- Augment minority data  
- Collect more data  

---

### 22) What data augmentations are safe for MRI?
**Answer:**  
Mild rotations, translations, intensity scaling. Avoid flips that may distort brain laterality.

---

### 23) Why convert MRI images to RGB in code?
**Answer:**  
Pretrained models expect 3-channel input. Grayscale MRIs are duplicated into RGB channels for compatibility.

---

### 24) Why does CrossEntropyLoss expect logits not probabilities?
**Answer:**  
It internally applies log-softmax + NLL for stability. Passing probabilities breaks this.

---

### 25) What does `torch.no_grad()` do during validation?
**Answer:**  
It disables gradient tracking, saving memory and speeding up inference.

---

### 26) What is Batch Normalization and why is it used?
**Answer:**  
It normalizes activations per batch → stabilizes training, allows higher learning rates, reduces sensitivity to initialization.

---

### 27) Why add Dropout before the final FC layer?
**Answer:**  
It randomly drops activations during training, forcing redundancy and reducing overfitting.

---

### 28) How do you choose optimizer and learning rate?
**Answer:**  
Adam with lr=1e-4 is good for fine-tuning. Larger lr for training from scratch. Adjust by monitoring validation loss.

---

### 29) What is early stopping and why use it?
**Answer:**  
It halts training if validation stops improving, preventing overfitting and saving compute.

---

### 30) How do you compare multiple models?
**Answer:**  
Train each, evaluate metrics (accuracy/F1) on same validation set, then test the best-performing one.

---

### 31) Why is patient-level splitting important?
**Answer:**  
Without it, images from the same patient may appear in train/val → data leakage, inflated performance.

---

### 32) Difference between saving `state_dict` vs whole model?
**Answer:**  
- `state_dict`: only weights, portable.  
- Whole model: architecture + weights, but fragile across PyTorch versions.

---

### 33) How to get classifier input size (`in_features`)?
**Answer:**  
- ResNet: `model.fc.in_features`  
- MobileNet: `model.classifier[1].in_features`  
Or use a dummy forward pass.

---

### 34) What is a learning rate scheduler?
**Answer:**  
It adjusts learning rate during training (e.g., reduces on plateau). Helps fine-tune convergence.

---

### 35) How to deploy this model for inference?
**Answer:**  
Export with TorchScript/ONNX, wrap in API (Flask/FastAPI), preprocess inputs, run under `torch.no_grad()`, return predictions.

---

### 36) What is `classification_report`?
**Answer:**  
It shows per-class precision, recall, F1, and support, helping diagnose strengths/weaknesses.

---

### 37) What is sensitivity and specificity?
**Answer:**  
- Sensitivity (Recall): TP / (TP+FN) → detects actual positives.  
- Specificity: TN / (TN+FP) → correctly identifies negatives.

---

### 38) How to compute ROC/AUC for multiclass?
**Answer:**  
Use one-vs-rest for each class, or compute macro/micro averaged AUC. Needs softmax probabilities.

---

### 39) How to improve an overfitting model?
**Answer:**  
Add more data, augmentations, increase dropout, weight decay, early stopping, or use transfer learning.

---

### 40) Why is reproducibility important and how to set seeds?
**Answer:**  
Reproducibility ensures repeatable results. Set seeds for Python, numpy, torch, and configure cudnn for determinism.

---

### 41) Difference between logits and probabilities?
**Answer:**  
Logits = raw outputs. Probabilities = softmax(logits), sum to 1. Loss functions often expect logits.

---

### 42) How to run inference on a single image?
**Answer:**  
Load model + weights, preprocess image, add batch dimension, run with `model.eval()` + `torch.no_grad()`, apply softmax + argmax.

---

### 43) What are `num_workers` and `pin_memory` in DataLoader?
**Answer:**  
- `num_workers`: parallel processes for faster loading.  
- `pin_memory`: speeds up GPU transfers.

---

### 44) How to do hyperparameter tuning?
**Answer:**  
Use grid/random search over lr, batch size, optimizer, weight decay, augmentation. Track validation metrics.

---

### 45) Transfer learning vs training from scratch?
**Answer:**  
- Transfer learning: faster, better with small data, reuses pretrained features.  
- From scratch: needs more data, but learns domain-specific features.

---

### 46) Why might ImageNet models be suboptimal for MRI?
**Answer:**  
MRI textures differ from photos. Pretrained features help but domain gap exists. Better to fine-tune more layers or use medical-pretrained models.

---

### 47) How to make model interpretable for clinicians?
**Answer:**  
Use Grad-CAM, saliency maps, confidence scores, and prototypes. Helps build trust but must be clinically validated.

---

### 48) What is model ensembling?
**Answer:**  
Combining outputs from multiple models (avg/vote). Improves accuracy but increases inference cost.

---

### 49) Common pitfalls in medical image classifiers?
**Answer:**  
Data leakage, small datasets, wrong augmentations, poor labeling, lack of external validation, no clinical review.

---

### 50) Next steps to improve this project?
**Answer:**  
Do patient-level splits, collect more data, apply careful augmentation, try stronger transfer learning, add interpretability, and validate externally before clinical use.
