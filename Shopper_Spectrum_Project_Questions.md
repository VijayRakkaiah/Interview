## 1. K-Means Algorithm (Unsupervised Learning)

**Imagine you have a big box of mixed LEGO pieces.**  
Some are red, some blue, some green. Some are big, some small. You don’t know how many types there are.

**K-Means is like a smart robot that tries to group similar pieces together into "buckets" (clusters).**

- You tell it how many groups (`K`) you want.
- It starts by randomly picking `K` LEGO pieces to be the "centers."
- Then, it goes through all the pieces and groups them based on which center they’re closest to.
- It recalculates the center of each group (based on the average of the pieces in it).
- It does this again and again until the groups don’t change much.

✅ **Unsupervised** means you don’t tell the robot what the correct answer is — it figures it out on its own.

## 2. Elbow Method

**How do I know how many buckets (`K`) I should use in K-Means?**

That’s where the **Elbow Method** comes in.

- You try K-Means with K=1, 2, 3, … up to maybe 10.
- For each, you calculate how "tight" the LEGO groups are (how close each piece is to its group center).
- You plot it on a graph.

👉 The graph usually goes down fast at first, then slows down and bends like an elbow.  
💡 The **“elbow point”** is often the best number of clusters to choose.

## 3. Cosine Similarity

Let’s say you and a friend both make playlists of your favorite songs.

- You both like pop, rock, and a little jazz.
- Your **taste is similar**, but not exactly the same.

**Cosine similarity** is a way to measure how similar two things are — like two people’s preferences or two documents — by looking at the **angle** between them instead of just numbers.

👬 If the angle is small (close to 0°), the similarity is **high** (you’re very similar).  
🔀 If the angle is big (close to 90°), you’re **not very similar**.

It works well when **direction (type of interest)** is more important than **magnitude (how much)**.

## 4. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

RFM is a way to understand customer behavior, like for an online store.

- **Recency**: How recently did the customer buy something?
- **Frequency**: How often do they buy?
- **Monetary**: How much money do they spend?

📦 Example:

| Customer | Last Order (days ago) | # Orders | Total Spent |
|----------|------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Alice    | 3                      | 12       | $500         |
| Bob      | 60                     | 2        | $80          |

Alice is a better customer: she buys often, recently, and spends more.  
🧠 Businesses use RFM to **segment customers** — like finding VIPs, new users, or those who might be leaving.

## 5. Silhouette Score

After you’ve grouped your LEGO pieces (or customers), you want to know:  
**“Did I do a good job?”**

The **Silhouette Score** tells you how well each item fits into its cluster.

- Score near **+1**: It’s well grouped.
- Score near **0**: It’s on the edge between two groups.
- Score near **-1**: It’s in the wrong group.

It helps you decide if your clusters **make sense**.

## 6. PCA (Principal Component Analysis - 2D)

Imagine you have a notebook with tons of columns: age, height, weight, income, spending, etc.

That’s hard to draw or visualize.  
**PCA helps you reduce many features into just 2 dimensions** (like a flat map), while still keeping the important patterns.

- It **rotates and squishes** the data into a 2D space.
- You lose a little detail but keep the big picture.
- Now you can **see** clusters or patterns that were hidden in many dimensions.

🎨 Think of PCA like turning a complex 3D sculpture into a flat drawing that still shows its basic shape.

## Summary Table

| Concept              | Easy Explanation |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **K-Means**           | Grouping similar things without knowing the answer first |
| **Elbow Method**      | Find the best number of groups by spotting the "elbow" in a graph |
| **Cosine Similarity** | How similar two things are based on angle, not size |
| **RFM**               | Understand customers using recency, frequency, and money spent |
| **Silhouette Score**  | Measures how well each item fits in its group |
| **PCA (2D)**          | Shrinks many features into 2D to make patterns easier to see |
